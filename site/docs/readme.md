### Setting Up Gulp to Build the Styles
I'm currently using Gulp to compile the Sass into css. In the future this could be expanded to all sorts of little tweaks for better website development.

To get it set up,
https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start

**NB - it might already be part of your machine due to the Node.js automatic dependency installation.**

Also do `npm install gulp-sass --save-dev` if this hasn't already been installed. Again, automatic dependency installation could have done this for you already.

I haven't set this up yet, but in the future we can integrate with VSCode.
